# PyProject Template

This template automatically create `hatch`-based repository based on the given repository name.
For example, if you create a repository "foo" with this template and wait a few seconds,
the repository becomes something like below.

```
.gitignore
.github/workflows/...
docs/index.md
tests/...
foo/__init__.py
foo/__about__.py
mkdocs.yml
pyproject.toml
LICENCE
README.md
```

After cloning the created repository, edit files according to your needs.
